First portion of the script before "#1"(in script) is data cleaning and data downloading.

#1 is where I am merging the training data and the test datasets
#2 is where the script is extracting only the mean and standard deviation for each of the measurements 
#3 is where naming of each of the activities is taking places
#4 is where the script is providing labels for the varibles names in the data set 
#5 is the last portion of the script where its averaging each varible for each of the activities/subjects
